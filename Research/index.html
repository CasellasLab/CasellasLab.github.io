<p class="lead">Our main goal is to unravel the nuclear events that drive early development and peripheral activation of B lymphocytes. In particular, we are interested in the processes that assemble, diversify, and provide effector functions to antibody molecules, including transcription, recombination, and hypermutation. Another major interest is to understand how deregulation of these mechanisms leads to B cell tumorigenesis. To achieve these goals, our team combines cutting-edge technologies, including genome editing, nanoscopy, Hi-C, cryo-EM, and bioinformatic tools.

One challenge facing the immune system is that it must recognize an infinite variety of immunogens with a relatively small number of cell surface receptors. To achieve nearly unlimited antigen recognition, vertebrates have evolved a series of genetic alterations that target immune receptor genes. In B cells developing in the bone marrow, heavy and light chain antibody genes are first assembled from variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) gene segments through V(D)J recombination. This reaction is catalyzed by the RAG1-2 recombinase.

Upon migration to the periphery, newly generated G0 B cells may encounter foreign antigens, leading to activation and cell cycle entry in less than 24h. How lymphocytes are able to respond so rapidly to infection has been a mystery. In the past 5 years, we have resolved this puzzle by showing that the genome of na√Øve B cells is poised. RNA polymerases, transcription factors, chromatin remodelers, histone acetyl and methyltransferases, nuclear architectural proteins, are all recruited to G0 chromatin in a manner nearly identical to that seen in activated counterparts. However, these enzymes only display basal activity until an optimal concentration of their catalytic substrates or cofactors is reached during activation. Because the enzymes are preloaded, their basal activity is globally and proportionally amplified (Figure 1). We have dubbed this new biological phenomenon (so far unique to lymphocytes) transcriptome, epigenome, and topological amplification. 
</p>

<p class="lead">
Activation of B cells also initiates a second round of antibody gene alterations. First, the Ch genes recombine to change the antibody isotype class, from IgM to IgG, IgE, or IgA. This process is known as class switch recombination (CSR) and is mediated by the AID cytidine deaminase. In addition, the V domain of antibody genes is hypermutated, a process that couple to selection enhances the affinity of antibodies for the immunogen. Like CSR, somatic hypermutation is driven by AID.

Both RAGs and AID can be promiscuous in nature, and the proclivity of B cells towards lymphomagenesis stems largely from RAG- and AID-mediated lesions across the genome which can create chromosomal translocations between oncogenes (e.g. MYC, PIM1, MIR142) and antibody genes. In a series of key studies also in the past 5 years our laboratory has identified the molecular basis for AID promiscuity. We have found that super-enhancers are preferential targets for AID because of their accessibility, topological complexity, and transcriptional activity (Figure 2). 
<h2> Current topics of interest in our laboratory include: </h2>
	<h3>
	<ol>
	<li>The impact of nuclear architecture in gene expression.</li>
	<li>The role of the Mediator complex in B cell transcriptional regulation.</li>
	<li>The generation of new mouse models that express antibodies of clinical interest</li>
	</ol>
